        <h4>The story</h4>
        <p style ="color: rgb(20, 20, 82); font-weight: bold;">
            Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said,<q class="villagers"> We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q>The farmer said, <q class="farmer">Maybe.</q> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said,<q class="villagers">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q> The farmer again said, <q class="farmer">Maybe.</q> 
        </p>
        <p style ="color: rgb(20, 20, 82)">
            The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, <q class="villagers"> Oh dear, that’s too <label class="bad" title="bad"> bad </label>,</q> and the farmer responded, <q class="farmer">Maybe.</q> The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q class="villagers">Isn’t that great!</q> Again, he said, <q class="farmer">Maybe.</q>
        </p>
